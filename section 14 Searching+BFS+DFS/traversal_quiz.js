//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
    //BFS: it starts where close to the parent

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
    //BFS: because DFS will take long.

//If the tree is very wide:
    //DFS: BFS will need too much memory

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
    //DFS   

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
    //DFS

//Finding the shortest path:
    //BFS
